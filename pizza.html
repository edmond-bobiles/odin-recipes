          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Gather all ingredients.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast 
              and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy 
              foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the 
              sides of the bowl.</li>

            <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>

            <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise 
              until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Let rise again 
              until doubled.</li>

            <li><strong>Make garlic oil:</strong> Combine olive oil with minced garlic in a 
              microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>

            <li><strong>Preheat the grill:</strong> Heat outdoor grill to high and brush the grate 
              with garlic oil.</li>

            <li><strong>Shape and grill the dough:</strong> Punch down dough and divide in half. Form 
              each half into an oblong shape about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>

            <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. It will begin to puff. When the 
              bottom is lightly browned, flip it using two spatulas.</li>

            <li>Quickly brush garlic oil over the crust.</li>

            <li>Top with 1/2 of each: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, 
              and basil.</li>

            <li>Close the grill lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove and cool for a few minutes. 
              Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
