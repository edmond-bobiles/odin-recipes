          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="steps-container">
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Take your cut-up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag. Season it with paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. 
                (Paprika helps to brown the chicken.)</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk, then add a few at a time to the bag of flour. Seal and shake to coat well.</li>
            <li>Place the coated chicken on a tray and cover with a clean towel or wax paper.  
                <strong>Let it sit until the flour forms a paste-like consistency â€” this step is crucial!</strong></li>
            <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until very hot.</li>
            <li>Add as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown both sides in hot oil.</li>
            <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover. Let cook for 30 minutes. Then uncover, raise heat, and fry until crispy.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels. If cooking in batches, keep finished chicken warm in the oven while frying the rest.</li>
          </ol>
