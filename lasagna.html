        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
            made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
            but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and 
            Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
            green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <p>Prep Time: 1 hr 25 mins. Cook Time: 1 hr 25 mins. Additional Time: 10 mins.
            Total Time: 2 hr 50 mins. Servings: 8. Yield: 1 9x13-inch lasagna.</p>
